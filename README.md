## Introduction

[Try this demo! (Google Maps API key is needed)](https://constantjin.github.io/streetview_exploration_demo/)

Demo for Google Street View control (and capture) with a keyboard.

- W/D keys to control the viewpoint (heading).
- A/S keys to move forward(backward) following the link arrows in the map.
- F key to capture the current scene as an image.
- You need to generate a **Google Maps API key** beforehand for this demo
  - You can follow [this guide](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) to generate Google Maps API key.

This demo is built on **[React](https://reactjs.org/) + Typescript** and bundled using [**Vite**](https://github.com/vitejs/vite).
Followings are the package that helped me _a lot_ for this project:

- [React Router v6](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router)
